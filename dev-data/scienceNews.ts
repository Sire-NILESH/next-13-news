        "Because older adults are under-represented in clinical trials, doctors can&#8217;t be certain that approved cancer drugs will work as intended in this age group. In the absence of high-quality evidence, researchers are looking for ways to improve medical decision-making and better predict outcomes based on age.",

      description:
        "The Vidalia onion is a trademarked variety of sweet onion that can only be grown in several counties in Georgia by law. These prized vegetables are currently threatened by the bacterial pathogen Pantoea ananatis, which severely damages the plant by rotting the onion bulbs and leaves. This results in substantial losses for onion growers in Georgia, as there are no disease resistant cultivars available. The plant toxin pantaphos, produced by the P. ananatis pathogen, causes the rotting symptoms in onion. More specifically, the eleven genes responsible for producing this toxin are grouped together...",
